## How to contribute
#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/adamico/mechanical-mastery-plus/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/adamico/mechanical-mastery-plus/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a minecraft log file (preferably uploaded to an appropriate website).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [discord channel](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-core) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

* We generally reject changes to Active Support core extensions. Those change should be proposed in the [Ruby issue tracker instead](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues), as we don't want to conflict with future versions of Ruby.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Ruby on Rails in the [rubyonrails-talk mailing list](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-talk).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Rails documentation?**

* Please read [Contributing to the Rails Documentation](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation).

Ruby on Rails is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join [the team](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org)!
