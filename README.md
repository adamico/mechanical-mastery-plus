# Mechanical Mastery Plus
is an unofficial Fabric and Forge 1.19.2 fork of the wonderful and beloved Mechanical Mastery skyblock modpack by Ammonium and approved by him.

The progression is mostly unchanged.

## Mod changes
Because of the major MC version change, I had to remove some non compatible mods though in some cases I was able to find a suitable replacement.
For obvious reasons the Fabric port has a different mod palette even if I tried to stay in the theme. 

I took the liberty to remove mods with duplicate, annoying or barely used features and I even chose to use less known and less technologically themed mods just to add some variation to the pack theme.

<details>
<summary>Detailed changes for the Forge version</summary>

**Removed mods:**
- Waystones => not very useful in a skyblock pack with no exploration needed
- Carry On => barely used and interference with shift+right tier upgrades for Mekanism machines
- Crafting Station => in theory very useful to access a connected inventory but actually pretty limited and not very user friendly. In addition, crafting a quest item doesn't trigger the quest completion until you close the UI. Using a sophisticated backpack with crafting and stack upgrades is a much better option
- Dank Storage => other personal inventory mods exist in the pack and not very useful in this particular flavor of a skyblock pack
- Framed Compact Drawers => Functional Storage has built-in framed blocks functionality
- Iron Jetpacks =>  because you can easily have easy and early creative flight wth ProjectE
- Item Collectors => because Functional Storage has an addon and Mob Grinding Utils has the Absorption Hopper
- Lazierae2 => because there's no 1.19.x version and not needed for AE in MC 1.19.x
- Super Circuit Maker 2 => because there's no 1.19 version
- Thermal Locomotion => because other than building a circular railway for show...
- Toast Control => Because rubidium extras does that

**Replaced mods:**
- Building Gadgets => even if I love Direwolf20 mods, I decided to replace it with Effortless Building a less known but equally powerful build mod
- Crafting on a Stick => replaced with the more useful Crafting Slots which converts 9 of the player's inventory slots to a portable workbench
- Fast Leaf Decay => replaced with Leaves be Gone
- Storage Drawers => replaced with Functional Storage because of the collector/push/pull upgrades which are particularly useful in the pack and allow removing some mods
- Iron Chests => replaced with Iron Chests: Restocked because dollies!
- Mini Utilities => grrrrr... this one caused me headaches... the required lemonlib causes a crash in 1.19.2 which could be easily solved ([when this PR is accepted](https://github.com/OneLemonyBoi/LemonLib/pull/6))... for now I've removed the mob and added [Mob Grinding Utils](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mob-grinding-utils) for the mob spawning, killing and drop collection. I thought about adding standalone Angel Ring and Angel Block but other mods have the same functionalities (ProjectE and Construction Wand respectively).
- Pack Menu => replaced with [Fancy Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/fancymenu) because fancy
- Quark => replaced with [Bridging Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/bridging-mod) because I don't think we need the other features
- Shutup Experimental Settings => [Yeetus Experimentus](https://modrinth.com/mod/yeetus-experimentus) because there's no 1.19 version
- The One Probe => [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade) because of the empire
- Tiny Redstone and Gates => [Redstone Pen](https://modrinth.com/mod/redstonepen) because I love writing
